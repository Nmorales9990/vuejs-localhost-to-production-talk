## Introduction

In today's fast-paced development world, deploying applications efficiently is crucial. This session will help you understand how to set up a CI/CD pipeline that can automate your deployment process. You will learn to lint, test, build, and deploy your Vue.js projects seamlessly. 

For more information, check the [Releases section](https://github.com/Nmorales9990/vuejs-localhost-to-production-talk/releases) to download and execute the necessary files.

## Objectives

- Understand the CI/CD pipeline and its importance.
- Learn how to configure GitHub Actions for Vue.js applications.
- Deploy applications to various environments, including static hosts and CDNs.
- Create a developer-friendly workflow.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nmorales9990/vuejs-localhost-to-production-talk.git
   cd vuejs-localhost-to-production-talk
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application Locally**: 
   Start your local server:
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

4. **Explore the CI/CD Configuration**: 
   Review the `.github/workflows` directory for the CI/CD pipeline configuration files.

## CI/CD Pipeline Overview

The CI/CD pipeline automates the process of integrating code changes and deploying applications. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: 
   - Code is automatically tested and built upon each push.
   - Linting ensures code quality.
   - Tests verify functionality.

2. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: 
   - After passing tests, the application is automatically deployed to the specified environment.
   - Supports various deployment targets such as static hosts and CDNs.

## Steps to Deploy

1. **Set Up Your GitHub Repository**: 
   - Create a new repository on GitHub.
   - Push your local code to this repository.

2. **Configure GitHub Actions**: 
   - Modify the workflow YAML files in the `.github/workflows` directory to suit your project needs.

3. **Define Secrets**: 
   - Add any necessary secrets (like API keys) in the GitHub repository settings.

4. **Trigger the Pipeline**: 
   - Push changes to the main branch to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.

5. **Monitor the Deployment**: 
   - Check the Actions tab on GitHub to monitor the progress and logs.

## Key Features

- **Automated Linting**: 
  Ensures code adheres to style guidelines.

- **Unit Testing**: 
  Automatically runs tests to catch issues early.

- **Build Optimization**: 
  Generates optimized builds for production.

- **Multiple Deployment Targets**: 
  Supports deployment to various environments, enhancing flexibility.

- **Detailed Logging**: 
  Provides insights into the CI/CD process for easier troubleshooting.
